# Autoliv 77GHz Multi-Mode Radar (MMR) Driver
### &copy; Renyuan (Leo) Zhang and Fuheng Deng @ TuSimple

***
__Usage:__
```
roslaunch autoliv autoliv.launch
```

This driver obtains Autoliv MMR targets information from CAN bus. It consists of sending request messages, receving parser and visualization module. The updated documentation can be seen from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zfzqNDH9UyX53ZeJzj3LbW7oD1lHy9ad/view?usp=sharing). The evaluation report by Leo is shown [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M_NcZc1VBaWdLAGSzmukq5m5ttpycX54jE2wl7v1Ylg/edit?usp=sharing).

__List of ROS message:__

/autoliv/markers        # markers for visualization
/autoliv/targets        # target information
/autoliv/versions       # versions of radar

The accurate max range is about 60 meters and the FOV is about 80Â°.

The filtering algorithm is implemented separately in another repo [radar-tool](https://github.com/TuSimple/radar-tool). 

__Full communication cycle:__

+ Send a sync message at 0x100.
+ Command all the sensors at 0x201 to 0x204.
+ Target messages are beginning at 0x300 and max of 140 dectections.
+ Diagnostic messages are 0x3E1 to 0x3E3. A diag code True indicates a serious fault.
+ Version message is at 0x3EF.
+ 0x3FF gives the valid detections.
